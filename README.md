ANSIBLE WRAPPER SETTINGS
========================

**WARNING! This repository and ansible wrapper pipelines currently is under development progress. There is no up-to-date
README and properly working code**.

YAML settings for ansible wrapper pipeline(s).

## TLDR

A set of yaml settings for 'universal-ansible-wrapper' pipeline with a format like GitLab CI. The main idea is not to 
write a custom pipelines for every ansible role.

## USAGE

An abstract example of yaml settings for a wrapper looks like [**example.yaml**](settings/example-pipeline.yaml).
